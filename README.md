Does your mobile messaging app use strong end-to-end encryption by **default** when you talk to your friends?
---
**Strong =**
* Allows for key verification
* Uses up-to-date encryption protocols
* Forward secrecy, usually through OTR or ratcheting

**End-to-end =**
* Messages can't be decrypted by an intermediate server
* Messages aren't stored in plaintext by an intermediate server

**Default =**
* E2E encryption is automatically on for all messaging methods
* The user does not need to activate E2E encryption on first use
* Offering an optional "private" or "incognito" mode doesn't count


---
**TODO:**
* Find a good technical / operational analysis of ChatSecure.
* Make a nifty chart that shows the attributes of each app.
* Do apps use certificate pinning?
* Do apps encrypt local storage of messages?
